### Hello there. I’m Laura. 👋🏻
#### Introduction to @littlehoushontheprairie
I am a software engineer. Many of my repositories are for me help construct tools that help better my life, protect my privacy, and to allow others to use what I have learned to either build upon their skills or to use as examples. The repos that I have created are mostly were out of necessary to streamline the redundancies in my life.

#### What am I interested? 🤔
While I have may interests, there are some that I am mainly looking for. Creativity, problem solving, curiosity and privacy help form the pillars of my interests.
  - Self-host servers using [containers](https://github.com/littlehoushontheprairie/hou.sh-docker-compose).
  - Develop scripts to trigger small tasks that keep me updated [like when a death in the family occurs](https://github.com/littlehoushontheprairie/check-obituaries) or when my home IP changes, [updating a firewall](https://github.com/littlehoushontheprairie/linode-update-firewall).
  - Organize my data in a way that I can aggregate it like financing.
  - Develop fun DIY electronic projects like [Halloween jack]() or an automated garden.


#### What am I learning? 🤓
Learning is something that continues. I like to be the jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than master of one. It allows me to expand my career while engaging my curiosity.
  - Docker
  - Java/Kotlin
  - SQL
  - ReactJS
  - Python
  - Etc.
